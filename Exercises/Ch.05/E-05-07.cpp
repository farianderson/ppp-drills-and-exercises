// 7. Quadratic equations are of the form a∗x^2 + b∗x + c = 0. To solve these,
//                                         −b ± √(b^2 − 4ac)
//    one uses the quadratic formula: x = ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯. There is a
//                                                2a
//    problem, though: if b^2 − 4ac is less than zero, then it will fail. 
//    Write a program that can calculate x for a quadratic equation. Create a
//    function that prints out the roots of a quadratic equation, given a, b,
//    c. When the program detects an equation with no real roots, have it 
//    print out a message. How do you know that your results are plausible? 
//    Can you check that they are correct?
