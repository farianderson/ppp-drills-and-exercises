//18. Write a program to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is of
//    the form
//    ax 2 + bx + c = 0
//    If you donâ€™t know the quadratic formula for solving such an expression,
//    do some research. Remember, researching how to solve a problem is of-
//    ten necessary before a programmer can teach the computer how to solve
//    it. Use doubles for the user inputs for a, b, and c. Since there are two
//    solutions to a quadratic equation, output both x1 and x2.
