This is my attempt to get more familiar with git and github.
I'm learning C++ so i decided to make a repository of my solutions to the drills and exersices in Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming book.
The solutions are not guaranteed to be complete. You can find some solutions from Bjarne himself at https://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Solutions/exercise_solutions.html
There are also a lot of repositories on github sharing their own solutions.
Im learning git from https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
And i'm using debian-sid as my OS and vim as my editor (the README is written by nano btw ;).
