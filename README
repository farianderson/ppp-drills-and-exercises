-This is my attempt to get more familiar with git and github.
-I'm learning C++ so i decided to make a repository of my solutions to the drills and
 exersices in Bjarne Stroustrup's book Programming Principles and Practice using c++.
-The solutions are not guaranteed to be complete. Here you can find some solutions by
 the author at https://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Solutions/exercise_solutions.html
-You can also find a lot of repositories on github that share their own solutions.
-Learning git from https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
-Using debian-sid OS and vim editor.
